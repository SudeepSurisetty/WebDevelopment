#Mastermind Game

I have tried the mastermind game but used numbers instead of colors, and chosen whites,reds as variables to depict the white and red pins used in the original game.

* The Game generates a random number(4 digit) when the page is loaded. This number is hidden from the player.
* The Player need to input a 4 digit number as input.
* For every match of the input with the hidden number
    A red flag variable is incremented if the position and value is matched.
    A white flag variable is incremented to mention if value is matched but not the position. Similarly it also displays how       many input digits are totally wrong.
    
    
Try out and Have fun!!!
